The year was 2018. Not only it was the first time that I would go to an island, but it was also going to be the first time I would sit inside an airplane. The excitement was real. The background here is that my maternal grandfather wanted to go on a vacation with all his extended family. He had decided that it was going to be something special. That is when he proposed this idea to us and my aunt's family in Jaipur. Although it was going to be a difficult task to leave your work and go on a trip for a week, but everybody decided to manage. I have never seen my father not work for such a long period of time. Running a business means that you are working all the time. There are no holidays and no closing hours. As he thought that he will try to run the operations from there only, it didn't work out.</p></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-6 align-self-center text-center"><img src="./img/andaman1.jpg" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" style="max-height:400px"></div></div><div class="row mb-3"><div class="col-12 col-sm-6 order-last order-sm-first align-self-center"><img src="./img/andaman2.jpg" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail"></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-6 order-first order-sm-last"><p>The first thing we instantly realised when we reached there was that... "THERE WAS NO MOBILE RECEPTION!!". Ok, no is a little exaggeration but it was really bad. The only signal that any mobile was able to catch was BSNL 2G. That too in limited places. We knew that this was going to be the real holiday, absolutely no connection with the outside world. We visited three Islands:-</p><ul><li>Port Blair</li><li>Havelock Island</li><li>Neil Island</li></ul>Port Blair was the only place where we got Wifi in the hotel that too was slower than 2G. My father who receives atleast 100 calls a day had no call to answer. We travelled from island to island in a cruise. The only reason we were able to enjoy all this is because of my Nanaji and Naniji. The whole credit for this trip goes to them.<p></p></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-6"><h5>My Address</h5><address>5013-14, Guru Nanak Marg<br>Ambala Cantt-133001<br>Haryana<br>Email: <a href="mailto:utkarshbansal210@gmail.com">utkarshbansal210@gmail.com</a><br></address></div><div class="col-6"><h5>Find me at</h5><div><a class="btn btn-social-icon btn-linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/utkarsh-bansal-5a406815a/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin fa-lg"></i></a> <a class="btn btn-social-icon btn-twitter" href="https://twitter.com/utsbansal" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-lg"></i></a> <a class="btn btn-social-icon btn-github" href="https://github.com/utsbansal" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i></a></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto"><p>Designed & Developed by Utkarsh Bansal</p></div></div></div></footer></div><script src="js/main.js"></script></body></html>
